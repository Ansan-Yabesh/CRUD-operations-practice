# CRUD Operations Practice

This repository contains a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Express.js and MongoDB.
It demonstrates full CRUD functionality for both Users and Products, showcasing how to create, retrieve, update, and delete records.

This is my first CRUD project, developed by Ansan Yabesh, and it is fully functional.

## 📁 Project Structure
```
├── controllers/     # Request handlers
├── models/         # Database schemas
├── routes/         # API routes
├── db/            # Database connection
└── app.js         # Main application
```

**Ready to use!** Your API will save all changes to MongoDB database.
